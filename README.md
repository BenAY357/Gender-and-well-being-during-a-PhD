# Gender-and-well-being-during-a-PhD

This project was my coursework for Intermediate Statistics. It scored 87.5. For our task, we were given the Nature Research Group PhD Student Survey 2019 and asked to pre-register and conduct a secondary analysis. I decided to investigate the relationship between gender and well-being during a PhD. Hence, my two research questions were:

<ol>
<li>Is there a relationship between gender and meeting/ conference self-efficacy during a PhD?</li>
<li>Is there an association between gender and likelihood to be bullied during a PhD?</li>
</ol>

<b> TLDR; </b>
<ul>
<li>The three genders present in the survey were male, female and gender queer/ non binary</li>
<li>Gender and meeting/ conference self-effiacy during the PhD did not differ between the genders</li>
<li>Only females were more likely to be bullied than males.</li>
</ul>

<b>Limitations:</b>

The data was very unbalanced. There were a lot more males and females than gender queer students. Future studies may want to recruit more gender queer participants.
